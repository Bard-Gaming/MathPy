## About
MathPy is a Python library that acts as a completely new
programming language.

The goal of this project is to experiment with strings as 
numbers in a high enough base to allow for a multitude of
characters, and to see if this could be a viable alternative
to the classical way of implementing character strings.

For instance, in hexadecimal, the string "baba" would
have a numerical value of 47802.
